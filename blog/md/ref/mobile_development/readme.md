## Flutter

This is an excellent framework for developing cross-platform native mobile applications in 2024. Like Golang, TensorFlow, and Angular, Flutter is also from Google, which uses Dart (another programming language from Google) and provides SDK for developing a cross-platform native mobile application.

Itâ€™s always been challenging to release your app to different platforms like Android, iOS, and Windows Mobile, as you need to maintain a separate codebase. Flutter solves that problem by allowing you to create mobile apps for both iOS and Android devices using the same codebase.
