# Big Data Analytics Syllabus

## Homework and Projects

* Every two weeks
* Final Project

## Outcome and Expectations

After this class, students will have a general idea of the core toolchains of big data analysis in the market and will be able to utilize the most popular programming language and libraries to do the data access, collection, curation and analysis. And we also survey the best and up-to-date commercial platforms of big data analysis and get our hands on their usage.

## 15 Weeks Schedule

Week 1. Introduction to Big Data Analytics

Get familiarized with Docker, Hadoop container, and learn how Hadoop’s components and distributed file system.  We will talk about Hadoop and Spark. And the installation of Hadoop, both the native way and the dockerized container.

Week 2. Hadoop Distributed File Systems, S3 and MapReduce

In-class Hadoop Lab and compile Java code to run the distributed jobs and see how to receive the file results. We will introduce Hadoop’s DFS commands and how to compile and run the examples to run the distributed jobs. And also we will introduce NCDC Dataset.
