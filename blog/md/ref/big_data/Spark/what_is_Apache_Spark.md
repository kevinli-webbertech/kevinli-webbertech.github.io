## What is Apache Spark?

Have you ever been training a machine learning model and the training data that you get is bigger than the machine that you have?

Or

Have you ever been running an SQL query and then you realize it’s going to take all the night to finish?

You could just buy a bigger machine and upgrade it or you could just patiently wait for the SQL query to finish.

But what about when the training data grows and grows and grows and grows and your database starts to go into the millions and millions of rows?

A great solution to this is **Apache Spark!**

Apache Spark takes your big data problem and gives you a much quicker and more affordable solution to it.

Big data Problem:

1.	Code – Usually we address it using some code
2.	Hardware – run it on our hardware, which is where the problem usually arises (where hardware is not efficient enough)
3.	Storage  - Very often the data that you come out with is much bigger than the data that you started with.

Spark addresses it through its Stack!
