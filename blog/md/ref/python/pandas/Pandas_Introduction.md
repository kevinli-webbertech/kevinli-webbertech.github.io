# What is Pandas?

Pandas is a powerful python library that is specifically designed to work on data frames that have "relational" or "labeled" data. Its aim aligns with doing real-world data analysis using Python. 

Generally, pandas operates a data frame using **Series** and **DataFrame**; where Series works on a one-dimensional labeled array holding data of any type like **integers**, **strings**, and **objects**, while a DataFrame is a two-dimensional data structure that manages and operates data in tabular form (using rows and columns).

## Why Pandas?

The beauty of Pandas is that it simplifies the task related to data frames and makes it simple to do many of the time-consuming, repetitive tasks involved in working with data frames, such as:

* **Import datasets** - available in the form of spreadsheets, comma-separated values (CSV) files, and more.
* **Data cleansing** - dealing with missing values and representing them as NaN, NA, or NaT.
* **Size mutability** - columns can be added and removed from DataFrame and higher-dimensional objects.
* **Data normalization** – normalize the data into a suitable format for analysis.
* **Data alignment** - objects can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels.
* **Intuitive merging and joining data sets** – we can merge and join datasets.
* **Reshaping and pivoting of datasets** – datasets can be reshaped and pivoted as per the need.
* **Efficient manipulation and extraction** - manipulation and extraction of specific parts of extensive datasets using intelligent label-based slicing, indexing, and subsetting techniques.
* **Statistical analysis** - to perform statistical operations on datasets.
* **Data visualization** - Visualize datasets and uncover insights.

## Applications of Pandas

The most common applications of Pandas are as follows:

* **Data Cleaning**: Pandas provides functionalities to clean messy data, deal with incomplete or inconsistent data, handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardise formats to do effective data analysis.
* **Data Exploration**: Pandas easily summarise statistics, find trends, and visualise data using built-in plotting functions, Matplotlib, or Seaborn integration.
* **Data Preparation**: Pandas may pivot, melt, convert variables, and merge datasets based on common columns to prepare data for analysis.
* **Data Analysis**: Pandas supports descriptive statistics, time series analysis, group-by operations, and custom functions.
* **Data Visualisation**: Pandas itself has basic plotting capabilities; it integrates and supports data visualisation libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create innovative visualisations.
* **Time Series Analysis**: Pandas supports date/time indexing, resampling, frequency conversion, and rolling statistics for time series data.
* **Data Aggregation and Grouping**: Pandas groupby() function lets you aggregate data and compute group-wise summary statistics or apply functions to groups.
* **Data Input/Output**: Pandas makes data input and export easy by reading and writing CSV, Excel, JSON, SQL databases, and more.
* **Machine Learning**: Pandas works well with Scikit-learn for data preparation, feature engineering, and model input data.
* **Web Scraping**: Pandas may be used with BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to parse and analyse structured web data for web scraping and data extraction.
* **Financial Analysis**: Pandas is commonly used in finance for stock market data analysis, financial indicator calculation, and portfolio optimisation.
* **Text Data Analysis**: Pandas' string manipulation, regular expressions, and text mining functions help analyse textual data.
* **Experimental Data Analysis**: Pandas makes manipulating and analysing large datasets, performing statistical tests, and visualising results easy.
