# Google MAP API

## Get a google map API key from google

## Check distance python example


**Step 1: Visit the GCP Console: Go to the Google Cloud Platform Console.**

Create a New Project:

Click on the project dropdown at the top of the page.
Click on the “New Project” button.
Enter a project name and select your billing account.

**Step 2: Enable the Google Maps APIs**
Navigate to the APIs & Services Dashboard:

From the GCP Console, click on the menu icon in the top left corner.
Navigate to “APIs & Services” > “Library.”
Enable APIs:

In the API Library, search for “Maps.”

**Step 3: Generate the API Key**
Navigate to Credentials:

In the APIs & Services dashboard, click on “Credentials” in the left sidebar.
Create Credentials:

Click on the “Create Credentials” button.
Select “API Key.”
Restrict the API Key (Recommended):

Click on the “Edit” icon next to your newly created API key.
Under “API restrictions,” select the APIs you enabled in Step 2.
Under “Application restrictions,” restrict the key to your IP addresses or HTTP referrers to prevent unauthorized use.
Copy the API Key: Your API key will be displayed on the screen. Copy this key, as you will need it for your Python script.

**Step 4: Write the Python Script**
import googlemaps
from datetime import datetime

# Initialize the Google Maps client with your API key
gmaps = googlemaps.Client(key='YOUR_API_KEY')
