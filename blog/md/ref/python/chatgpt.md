# Get response

The max_tokens parameter in the OpenAI API is used to specify the maximum number of tokens that the model is allowed to generate in its response. Here's a breakdown of how this works:

## What is a Token?

Tokens can be as short as one character or as long as one word (or slightly longer).
For example, the word "ChatGPT" would be a single token, and so would a punctuation mark like ",".

## Purpose of max_tokens

Limit the Output Length: By setting max_tokens, you control the length of the response. This is useful for ensuring that the output is concise and does not exceed a certain length.
Cost Management: OpenAI charges for usage based on the number of tokens processed (both in the input prompt and the generated output). Setting a max_tokens limit helps in managing costs by capping the number of tokens used in the response.
Performance: Limiting the number of tokens can also improve response times as fewer tokens mean the model generates the response more quickly.

## Example Usage

If you set max_tokens=150, the model will generate a response with up to 150 tokens. It might generate fewer tokens if it completes its response before hitting the limit.
