### cut examples

```
touch words.txt

happy
world
hello John

[img missing]
List without ranges:
cut -b 1,2,3 state.txt

[img missing]

cut -b 1-3,5-7 state.txt

[img missing]

```

Special Form: Selecting bytes from beginning to end of line
In this, 1- indicate from 1st byte to end byte of a line

`cut -b 1- state.txt`

In this, -3 indicate from 1st byte to 3rd byte of a line

`cut -b -3 state.txt`

Cut by Character (-c) Using cut Command

-c (column): To cut by character use the -c option. This selects the characters given to the -c option. This can be a list of numbers separated comma or a range of numbers separated by hyphen(-).

Tabs and backspaces are treated as a character. It is necessary to specify list of character numbers otherwise it gives error with this option.

Syntax:

`cut -c [(k)-(n)/(k),(n)/(n)] filename`

Extract specific characters:

`cut -c 2,5,7 state.txt`

Extract first seven characters:

`cut -c 1-7 state.txt`

Above command prints starting from first character to end.

`cut -c -5 state.txt`

Above command prints starting position to the fifth character.

Cut by Field (-f) Using cut Command

-f (field): -c option is useful for fixed-length lines. Most unix files doesn’t have fixed-length lines. To extract the useful information you need to cut by fields rather than columns. List of the fields number specified must be separated by comma. Ranges are not described with -f option. cut uses tab as a default field delimiter but can also work with other delimiter by using -d option.

`cut -f 1 state.txt`

If `-d` option is used then it considered space as a field separator or delimiter:

`cut -d " " -f 1 state.txt`

Extract fields 1 to 4:
Command prints field from first to fourth of each line from the file.

`cut -d " " -f 1-4 state.txt`

### sort examples

Sure, here's a simple example of using the `sort` command in Linux:

Let's say you have a file called `names.txt` with the following content:

```
John
Alice
Bob
Zoe
```

To sort the names alphabetically, you can use the `sort` command like this:

```bash
sort names.txt
```

This will output:

```
Alice
Bob
John
Zoe
```

By default, `sort` sorts lines of text in ascending order, which means alphabetically for strings. If you want to sort in descending order, you can use the `-r` option:

```
sort -r names.txt
```

This will output:

```
Zoe
John
Bob
Alice
```

You can also use `sort` to sort the output of a command. For example, if you have a list of numbers stored in a file called `numbers.txt`, you can sort them like this:

```
cat numbers.txt | sort -n
```

This will sort the numbers numerically in ascending order. If you want to sort them in descending order, you can use:

```
cat numbers.txt | sort -n -r
```

### sed examples 

sed 's/old/new/' file.txt                       Substitute (replace) text
sed '/pattern/i\new line of text' file.txt       Insert text before a line

### tr Example: 

echo "hello world" | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'              Translate lowercase to uppercase

echo "hello 123 world" | tr -d '0-9'             Delete specific characters

### awk Example: 

awk '{print $1, $3}' file.txt                   Print specific columns

awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}' file.txt       Sum the values of a column

rev Example: 

echo "hello" | rev                              Reverse a single line

rev file.txt                                    Reverse the content of a file
```


## Text find, replace and regex

* `sed` Finds, replaces, or deletes patterns in a file
* `awk` Finds and manipulates patterns in a file
* `grep` Searches a string within a file

### Examples

```bash
grep patt /path/to/src	Search for a text pattern patt in X. Commonly used with pipe e.g., ps aux | grep python3 filters out the processes containing python3 from all running processes of all users.
grep -r patt /path/to/src	Search recursively (the target directory /path/to/src and its subdirectories) for a text pattern patt.
grep -v patt X	Return lines in X not matching the specified patt.
grep -l patt X	Write to standard output the names of files containing patt.
grep -i patt X	Perform case-insensitive matching on X. Ignore the case of patt.
sort X	Arrange lines of text in X alphabetically or numerically.
```

## Search

* `find` used to search for files and directories in a directory hierarchy based on various criteria like name, type, size, and modification time.

* `locate` command searches for files in a prebuilt database. It is faster than find because it searches through a database instead of the actual filesystem.

### Examples

```bash
find Find files.
find /path/to/src -name "*.sh"	Find all files in /path/to/src matching the pattern "*.sh" in the file name.
find /home -size +100M	Find all files in the /home directory larger than 100MB.
locate name	Find files and directories by name.
```

## File transfer

* `ssh` Secure Shell; used to log into a remote machine and execute commands
* `scp` Securely copies files or directories to another system
* `rsync` Synchronizes content between directories or machines
* sftp secured ftp

### Examples

```bash
ssh user@access	Connect to access as user.
ssh access	Connect to access as your local username.
ssh -p port user@access	Connect to access as user using port.
scp [user1@]host1:[path1] [user2@]host2:[path2]	Login to hostN as userN via secure copy protocol for N=1,2.

Example usage:
scp alice@pi:/home/source bob@arduino:/destination

path1 and path2 may be local or remote, but ensure they’re absolute rather than relative paths, e.g., /var/www/*.html, /usr/bin.

If user1 and user2 are not specified, scp will use your local username.
scp -P port [user1@]host1:[path1] [user2@]host2:[path2] Connect to hostN as userN using port for N=1,2.
scp -r [user1@]host1:[path1] [user2@]host2:[path2] Recursively copy all files and directories from path1 to path2.
sftp [user@]access Login to access as user via secure file transfer protocol. If user is not specified, your local username will be used.
sftp access	Connect to access as your local username.
sftp -P port user@access Connect to access as user using port.
rsync -a [path1] [path2] Synchronize [path1] to [path2], preserving symbolic links, attributes, permissions, ownerships, and other settings.
rsync -avz host1:[path1] [path2] Synchronize [path1] on the remote host host1 to the local path [path2], preserving symbolic links, attributes, permissions, ownerships, and other settings. It also compresses the data involved during the transfer.
```

`>/dev/null`: Redirects output to null device (discards output).

Example: command > /dev/null 2>&1  # Discards both standard output and standard error

`read`: Reads input from a file descriptor.

Example:

exec 3<myfile.txt  # Open file descriptor 3 for reading

read -u 3 line  # Read a line from file descriptor 3

echo $line  # Output the line read

exec 3<&-  # Close file descriptor 3

`strace`: Traces system calls and signals (including file descriptor operations).

Example: strace -e trace=file ls


## Pipe
The pipe (|) in Linux allows you to chain multiple commands together, sending the output of one command as input to another command.
`[command1] | [command 2]`
Basic Example:

`ps aux | grep python3 `: This command lists all running processes (ps aux) and pipes (|) the output to grep python3, which filters out lines containing python3.

`ls -l | wc -l` : This command lists all files in the current directory (ls -l) and pipes (|) the output to wc -l, which counts the number of lines, effectively giving the count of files in the directory.

`cat file.txt | sort` : This command reads the contents of file.txt (cat file.txt) and pipes (|) the output to sort, which sorts the lines alphabetically.
`

## Redirection

The redirect operator >, <, >>, 2>.


COMMAND              DESCRIPTION

`echo TEXT`          Display a line of TEXT or the contents of a variable.

`echo -e TEXT`       Also interprets escape characters in TEXT, e.g., \n → new line, \b → backslash, \t → tab.

`echo -n TEXT`       Omits trailing newline of TEXT.

`cmd1 | cmd2`        | is the pipe character; feeds the output of cmd1 and sends it to cmd2, e.g., ps aux | grep python3.

`cmd > file`         Redirect output of cmd to a file file. Overwrites pre-existing content of file.

`cmd >& file`        Redirect output of cmd to file. Overwrites pre-existing content of file. Suppresses the output of cmd.

`cmd > /dev/null`    Suppress the output of cmd.

`cmd >> file`        Append output of cmd to file.

`cmd < file`         Read input of cmd from file.

`cmd << delim`       Read input of cmd from the standard input with the delimiter character delim to tell the system where to terminate the input. Example for counting the number of lines of ad-hoc input:
```bash
wc -l << EOF
I like
apples
and
oranges.
EOF
```
Hence there are only 4 lines in the standard input delimited by EOF.

`cmd <<< string` Input a text string to cmd.

`cmd 2> foo`     Redirect error messages of cmd to foo.

`cmd 2>> foo`    Append error messages of cmd to foo.

`cmd &> file`    Redirect output and error messages of cmd to file.

`cmd &>> file`   Append output and error messages of cmd to file.









## Package and software management (debian)

* `apt`  A command-line utility for handling package management in Debian-based distributions.
* `apt-get` Manages Debian-based distros package libraries
* `dpkg`    dpkg is a medium-level tool to install, build, remove and manage Debian packages.

### apt and apt-get examples

The apt command line tool provides a higher-level user interface for end users with intuitive commands, resulting behaviors, and security features. In contrast, the command apt-get is a low-level interface that communicates more closely with core Linux processes. The apt command is a more user-friendly package manager than apt-get.

Used in Linux-based operating systems to update the package lists for available software packages from the configured repositories.

`sudo apt-get upgrade`

This command is used to install the latest versions of the packages currently installed on the user’s system from the sources enumerated in /etc/apt/sources.list. The installed packages which have new packages available are retrieved and installed. You need to perform an update before the upgrade so that apt-get knows that new versions of packages are available.

`sudo apt-get install [package_name]`

This command is used to install or upgrade packages.

`sudo apt-get remove [package_name]`

Remove software but does not remove configuration files

`sudo apt-get purge [package_name]`

Remove software and remove configuration files

`sudo apt-get check`

This command is used to update the package cache and check for broken dependencies.

`sudo apt-get clean`

This command is used to keep our system clean and tidy. It removes all the cached package files that were downloaded due to the downloading of recent packages using `apt-get`.

`sudo apt-get autoremove`

Sometimes the packages which are automatically installed to satisfy the dependencies of other packages, are no longer needed then the autoremove command is used to remove this kind of packages.

`sudo apt-get list`

It also gives details (version, architecture and repository source) about package but only if package is available or installed in our system. `sudo apt-get list firefox`

To get more options, check with -h,


Most used commands:
  `update` - Retrieve new lists of packages

  `upgrade` - Perform an upgrade

  `install` - Install new packages (pkg is libc6 not libc6.deb)

  `reinstall` - Reinstall packages (pkg is libc6 not libc6.deb)

  `remove` - Remove packages

  `purge` - Remove packages and config files

  `autoremove` - Remove automatically all unused packages

  `dist-upgrade` - Distribution upgrade, see apt-get(8)

  `dselect-upgrade` - Follow dselect selections

  `build-dep` - Configure build-dependencies for source packages

  `satisfy` - Satisfy dependency strings

  `clean` - Erase downloaded archive files

  `autoclean` - Erase old downloaded archive files

  `check` - Verify that there are no broken dependencies

  `source` - Download source archives

  `download` - Download the binary package into the current directory

  `changelog` - Download and display the changelog for the given package


### dpkg examples


  `install`
      The package is selected for installation.

  `hold`
      A package marked to be on hold is kept on the same version, that is, no automatic new
      installs, upgrades or removals will be performed on them, unless these actions are
      requested explicitly, or are permitted to be done automatically with the --force-hold
      option.

  `deinstall`
      The package is selected for deinstallation (i.e. we want to remove all files, except
      configuration files).

  `purge`
      The package is selected to be purged (i.e. we want to remove everything from system
      directories, even configuration files).

  `unknown`
      The package selection is unknown.  A package that is also in a not-installed state, and
      with an ok flag will be forgotten in the next database store.
