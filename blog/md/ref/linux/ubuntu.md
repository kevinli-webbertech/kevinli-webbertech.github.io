### startx command

The startx command in Linux starts an X session and has several uses, including:

**Starting an X session.**

The `startx` command starts an X session on a single computer.

**Booting Linux**

The startx command can boot Linux into runlevel 3 mode, which enables X11, multiuser, and networking.

**Passing options**

The startx command can pass command-line options to the X server, such as starting color-depth information.
Finding client commands

The startx command can find client commands or options to run for the session.

The startx command is a shell script that acts as a front end to xinit(1). It's often run without any arguments.

By default, the startx command sends errors to the .xerrors file in the user's home directory.
