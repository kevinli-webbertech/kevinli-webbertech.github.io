Keras - Model Evaluation and Model Prediction

Model Evaluation

-process during development of the model to check whether the model is best fit for the given problem and corresponding data
-Keras model provides a function, evaluate.
It has three main arguments
Test data
Test data label
verbose - true or false

evaluate the model

score = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose = 0) 

print('Test loss:', score[0]) 
print('Test accuracy:', score[1])

output
0

The test accuracy is 98.28%.

Model Prediction

Prediction is the final step and our expected outcome of the model generation.

signature of the predict method

predict(
   x, 
   batch_size = None, 
   verbose = 0, 
   steps = None, 
   callbacks = None, 
   max_queue_size = 10, 
   workers = 1, 
   use_multiprocessing = False
)


prediction for our MPL model

pred = model.predict(x_test) 
pred = np.argmax(pred, axis = 1)[:5] 
label = np.argmax(y_test,axis = 1)[:5] 

print(pred) 
print(label)

Line 1 call the predict function using test data.

Line 2 gets the first five prediction

Line 3 gets the first five labels of the test data.

Line 5 - 6 prints the prediction and actual label.

The output of the above application is as follows âˆ’
