"INTRODUCTION TO KERAS"

- Its an open source deep learning framework for python developed by an artificial intelligence researcher at google named Francois Chollet.
-organizations like Google, Square, Netflix, Huawei and Uber are currently using Keras.

what is deep learning?

-Its a subfield of machine learning framework.Deep learning is becoming more popular in data science fields like robotics, artificial intelligence(AI), audio & video recognition and image recognition
-Deep learning is supported by various libraries such as Theano, TensorFlow, Caffe, Mxnet etc.
keras is powerful and easy to use python library for creating deep learning models.

Overview of Keras

Keras is based on minimal structure that provides a clean and easy way to create deep learning models based on TensorFlow or Theano. Keras is designed to quickly define deep learning models. Well, Keras is an optimal choice for deep learning applications.
