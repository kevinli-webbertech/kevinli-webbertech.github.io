Keras backend implementations TensorFlow and Theano in detail

 TensorFlow
-pip install  TensorFlow

Once we execute keras, we could see the configuration file is located at your home directory inside and go to .keras/keras.json.

keras.json

{ 
   "image_data_format": "channels_last", 
   "epsilon": 1e-07, "floatx": "float32", "backend": "tensorflow" 
}

image_data_format represent the data format.

epsilon represents numeric constant. It is used to avoid DivideByZero error.

floatx represent the default data type float32. You can also change it to float16 or float64 using set_floatx() method.

image_data_format represent the data format.

Suppose, if the file is not created then move to the location and create using the below steps âˆ’
> cd home 
> mkdir .keras 
> vi keras.json

Remember, you should specify .keras as its folder name and add the above configuration inside keras.json file. We can perform some pre-defined operations to know backend functions.

Theano

-pip install theano

to change the backend to theano

keras.json

{ 
   "image_data_format": "channels_last", 
   "epsilon": 1e-07, 
   "floatx": "float32", 
   "backend": "theano" 
}
Now save your file, restart your terminal and start keras, your backend will be changed.

>>> import keras as k 
using theano backend.
