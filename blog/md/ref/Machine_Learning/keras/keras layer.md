Introduction

 requires shape of the input (input_shape) to understand the structure of the input data, initializer to set the weight for each input and finally activators to transform the output to make it non-linear

To summarise, Keras layer requires below minimum details to create a complete layer.

Shape of the input data
Number of neurons / units in the layer
Initializers
Regularizers
Constraints
Activations

 let us create a simple Keras layer using Sequential model API to get the idea of how Keras model and layer works.

from keras.models import Sequential 
from keras.layers import Activation, Dense 
from keras import initializers 
from keras import regularizers 
from keras import constraints 

model = Sequential() 

model.add(Dense(32, input_shape=(16,), kernel_initializer = 'he_uniform', 
   kernel_regularizer = None, kernel_constraint = 'MaxNorm', activation = 'relu')) 
model.add(Dense(16, activation = 'relu')) 
model.add(Dense(8))

where,

Line 1-5 imports the necessary modules.

Line 7 creates a new model using Sequential API.

Line 9 creates a new Dense layer and add it into the model. Dense is an entry level layer provided by Keras, which accepts the number of neurons or units (32) as its required parameter. If the layer is first layer, then we need to provide Input Shape, (16,) as well. Otherwise, the output of the previous layer will be used as input of the next layer. All other parameters are optional.

First parameter represents the number of units (neurons).

input_shape represent the shape of input data.

kernel_initializer represent initializer to be used. he_uniform function is set as value.

kernel_regularizer represent regularizer to be used. None is set as value.

kernel_constraint represent constraint to be used. MaxNorm function is set as value.

activation represent activation to be used. relu function is set as value.

Line 10 creates second Dense layer with 16 units and set relu as the activation function.

Line 11 creates final Dense layer with 8 units.

Basic Concept of Layers

Input shape


In machine learning, all types of input data (text, images, videos) are first converted into arrays of numbers before being fed into algorithms. These arrays can be one-dimensional, two-dimensional (matrix), or multi-dimensional. The shape of these arrays, specified as a tuple of integers, indicates their dimensions. For example, (4,2) represents a matrix with four rows and two columns.


>>> import numpy as np 
>>> shape = (4, 2) 
>>> input = np.zeros(shape) 
>>> print(input) 
[
   [0. 0.] 
   [0. 0.] 
   [0. 0.] 
   [0. 0.]
] 
>>>

Similarly, (3,4,2) three dimensional matrix having three collections of 4x2 matrix (two rows and four columns).

>>> import numpy as np 
>>> shape = (3, 4, 2) 
>>> input = np.zeros(shape) 
>>> print(input)
[
   [[0. 0.] [0. 0.] [0. 0.] [0. 0.]] 
   [[0. 0.] [0. 0.] [0. 0.] [0. 0.]] 
   [[0. 0.] [0. 0.] [0. 0.] [0. 0.]]
]
>>>
