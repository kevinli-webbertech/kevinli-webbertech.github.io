# Github Integration with EKS and Nexus 

This is a guide to set up a **CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions** to deploy applications to a **Kubernetes** cluster using **Nexus** as your Docker image registry.

### **1. Prerequisites**

Before we start, make sure you have:

* A **Nexus** instance running (preferably with a Docker repository set up).
* A **Kubernetes** cluster (e.g., EKS, GKE, AKS, or Minikube).
* GitHub repository for your project.

---

### **2. Repository Secrets Setup**

In your GitHub repository, you'll need the following secrets:

| Secret Name       | Description                                                |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DOCKER_USERNAME` | Nexus Docker registry username                             |
| `DOCKER_PASSWORD` | Nexus Docker registry password                             |
| `DOCKER_SERVER`   | Nexus Docker registry URL (e.g., `nexus.example.com:8081`) |
| `DOCKER_REPO`     | Nexus Docker repository name (e.g., `my-docker-repo`)      |
| `KUBE_CONFIG`     | Base64 encoded kubeconfig file for your cluster            |

To encode your `kubeconfig`, run:

```bash
cat ~/.kube/config | base64 -w 0
```

---

### **3. GitHub Actions Workflow File (ci-cd-pipeline.yml)**

Create a `.github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml` file in your repository:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-push:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3

    - name: Log in to nexus Docker Registry
      env:
        DOCKER_SERVER: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_SERVER }}
        DOCKER_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
        DOCKER_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
      run: |
        echo "${DOCKER_PASSWORD}" | docker login ${DOCKER_SERVER} -u ${DOCKER_USERNAME} --password-stdin

    - name: Build and Push Docker Image
      env:
        DOCKER_SERVER: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_SERVER }}
        DOCKER_REPO: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_REPO }}
      run: |
        IMAGE_NAME=${DOCKER_SERVER}/${DOCKER_REPO}/my-app:latest
        docker build -t ${IMAGE_NAME} .
        docker push ${IMAGE_NAME}

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build-and-push
    steps:
    - name: Setup kubectl
      uses: azure/setup-kubectl@v3

    - name: Configure kubectl
      env:
        KUBE_CONFIG: ${{ secrets.KUBE_CONFIG }}
      run: |
        echo "${KUBE_CONFIG}" | base64 -d > ~/.kube/config

    - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
      run: |
        kubectl set image deployment/my-app my-app-container=${{ secrets.DOCKER_SERVER }}/${{ secrets.DOCKER_REPO }}/my-app:latest
        kubectl rollout status deployment/my-app
```

---

### **4. Kubernetes Deployment YAML (my-app-deployment.yaml)**

Make sure you have a Kubernetes deployment ready, for example:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app-container
        image: nexus.example.com:8081/my-docker-repo/my-app:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        imagePullSecrets:
        - name: nexus-docker-secret
```

---

### **5. Test the Pipeline**

1. Commit and push the workflow file to the **main** branch.
2. Check the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository to verify the pipeline is running.
3. Ensure your Kubernetes cluster is ready to accept deployments.
