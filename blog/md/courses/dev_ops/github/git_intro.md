## Git History

Git was invented by *Linus Torvalds*, the creator of the Linux kernel. He started developing it on April 3, 2005, and 
achieved self-hosting (using Git to manage its own source code) by the next day. 

**Key aspects of Git's invention:**

* Rapid Development: Torvalds developed the initial framework in a little over a week, focusing on speed, simple design, and the ability to handle large projects efficiently.

* Design Goals: Torvalds designed Git as a content-addressable filesystem with strong support for non-linear, distributed development (rapid branching and merging), and robust data integrity features using SHA-1 hashes.

* Maintainership: In July 2005, Torvalds handed over the maintainership of the project to Junio Hamano, who has been the lead maintainer ever since.

* Naming: Torvalds quipped about the name "git" (which is British English slang for an unpleasant person), saying, "I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First 'Linux', now 'git'". 

## Git client and Git repo (History of Server Repo)

*GitHub*, *Bitbucket*, and *GitLab* are major Git repository hosting services that emerged between 2007 and 2011, each with a distinct focus and history. 

### GitHub

**Founded:** GitHub, Inc. was founded in 2007 by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner, and Scott Chacon, with the GitHub.com service launching in February 2008.

**Focus:** It quickly became the largest and most popular platform, widely used for open-source projects due to its strong community focus and intuitive interface.

**Key Milestones:**

By July 2010, it hosted one million repositories.
In 2018, Microsoft acquired GitHub for $7.5 billion.
It offers a large ecosystem of third-party integrations and tools like GitHub Actions for CI/CD. 

### Bitbucket

**Founded:** Bitbucket was launched in 2008 by Jesper Nøhr as an independent startup, initially focusing on hosting Mercurial projects.

**Focus:** It is primarily known for its strong integration with other Atlassian products (like Jira and Confluence), making it a strong choice for enterprise teams already using the Atlassian ecosystem.

**Key Milestones:**

Atlassian acquired Bitbucket on September 29, 2010.
Support for Git hosting was added in 2011.
In 2020, Atlassian dropped support for Mercurial to focus solely on Git.
A major selling point has been the offer of unlimited free private repositories for small teams. 

### GitLab

**Founded:** GitLab was created in 2011 as an open-source project by Ukrainian developer Dmytro Zaporozhets. Sytse Sijbrandij co-founded the company, GitLab Inc., in 2014.

**Focus:** It positions itself as an "all-in-one" DevSecOps platform, integrating the entire software development lifecycle (planning, coding, testing, deployment, and monitoring) into a single application.

**Key Milestones:**

It adopted an open-core business model, with core functionalities remaining free and open-source, and advanced features part of paid tiers.
It is known for its fully remote company structure and high degree of transparency, documented in a public GitLab Handbook.
In October 2021, GitLab became a publicly traded company on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol GTLB.

## Git Client Installation

Please go to the following website to make sure you find an installer for your operating system.

https://git-scm.com/downloads

Once the installation is done, please make sure that you have `git bash` in windows and that will be a little easier to practice the git commands.

## Git Usage Example

Git commands can be handy and there are also a lot of git GUI such as in `Visual tudio Code`, `Eclipse` or `IntelliJ` which could make it even easier.

As a beginner, I think learning some git commands are extremely helpful for you to understand how it works and you can troubleshoot some difficult issues when it comes up.

## Step 1: Git Checkout from Code Repo

In this step, we would like to check out someone's code from their github. In this case, we like to checkout from here,

`git clone https://github.com/kevinli-webbertech/kevinli-webbertech.github.io.git` 

First, let us open the following link,

![git_checkout](../../../../images/dev_ops/github/git_checkout.png)

Click the "Code" green button, and we copy the path from the following image,

![git_checkout-1](../../../../images/dev_ops/github/git_checkout-1.png)

There is a copy button the right,

![git_checkout-2](../../../../images/dev_ops/github/git_checkout-2.png)

This is the url you get,

`https://github.com/kevinli-webbertech/kevinli-webbertech.github.io.git`

Open your linux shell terminal or if you are in windows, you will use the git bash which is also a linux shell terminal.

Please create directory in your home, for instance,

`~/webbertech`,

then enter into the above directory,

`cd ~/webbertech.com`

In the following image, I created the directory in `/tmp/test`, for yourself, please make a more permanent directory,
Then next, we are going to run the following command,

`git clone https://github.com/kevinli-webbertech/kevinli-webbertech.github.io.git`

Then you will see it is in progress like below,

![git_checkout-3](../../../../images/dev_ops/github/git_checkout-3.png)

The above process checks out the code from the above repository, and we can see the process is done successfully in the image below.

![git_checkout-4](../../../../images/dev_ops/github/git_checkout-4.png)

## Step 2: Make your own development branch

```commandline
xiaofengli@xiaofenglx:/tmp/test$ ls
kevinli-webbertech.github.io
```

Then we `cd` into it and list what is in there, and we can see a lot of files. 

```commandline
xiaofengli@xiaofenglx:/tmp/test$ cd kevinli-webbertech.github.io/
xiaofengli@xiaofenglx:/tmp/test/kevinli-webbertech.github.io$ ls
blog	   Git.html	     package-lock.json	style.css
blog.html  google_analytics  push.sh		test_broken_links.sh
build.sh   html		     readme.md		test_output.txt
css	   index.html	     requirements.txt
dist	   js		     sitelock_service
docs	   package.json      start_server.sh
```

We run the following command. This is to check the current branch. The asterisk is the current branch.

```commandline
xiaofengli@xiaofenglx:/tmp/test/kevinli-webbertech.github.io$ git branch
* main
```

Now let us see what are the remote branches,

```commandline
xiaofengli@xiaofenglx:/tmp/test/kevinli-webbertech.github.io$ git branch -r
  origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  origin/create_blog_script
  origin/ft/course-load-test
  origin/ft/python-ds
  origin/lenin_lock
  origin/main
  origin/main-restored
  origin/rohini/Java
```

In this case, we need to create our own branch for development of the new contents, and we can run the following command to create a new branch off the `main` branch.

```commandline
xiaofengli@xiaofenglx:/tmp/test/kevinli-webbertech.github.io$ git checkout -b kevin_li_dev
Switched to a new branch 'kevin_li_dev'
xiaofengli@xiaofenglx:/tmp/test/kevinli-webbertech.github.io$ git branch
* kevin_li_dev
  main
```

Explanation:

* the `git checkout -b branch_name` is to create a branch.
* it would switch to the new branch automatically from wherever you were, for instance, we were on `main` branch before, and we always want to do that.
* `git branch` lists out all the branches in our local copy.

Next step is to push our new branch to the git repo.

```commandline
xiaofengli@xiaofenglx:/tmp/test/kevinli-webbertech.github.io$ git push
fatal: The current branch kevin_li_dev has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin kevin_li_dev
```

Just simply type `git push` it will tell you the full command.

Next, we copy the above command and rerun it.

```commandline
xiaofengli@xiaofenglx:/tmp/test/kevinli-webbertech.github.io$ git push --set-upstream origin kevin_li_dev
Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
remote: 
remote: Create a pull request for 'kevin_li_dev' on GitHub by visiting:
remote:      https://github.com/kevinli-webbertech/kevinli-webbertech.github.io/pull/new/kevin_li_dev
remote: 
To https://github.com/kevinli-webbertech/kevinli-webbertech.github.io.git
 * [new branch]      kevin_li_dev -> kevin_li_dev
Branch 'kevin_li_dev' set up to track remote branch 'kevin_li_dev' from 'origin'.
```

Now, we say that your branch is actually on the github server in kevin's repo. How do we know?

![git_remote_branch.png](../../../../images/dev_ops/github/git_remote_branch.png)

## Step 3: Edit contents in your development branch

You might want to modify a file, or add a new file. Once you are done you want to push your work back to the remote branch. How do we do that?

Now in my case, I have made many changes as of now in this file. Let us check what we have changed in our branch regarding our work.

In the previous step, I checked out everything into /tmp/test/..., but I actually have two copies, the other git checkout is in the following location.

![git_status.png](../../../../images/dev_ops/github/git_status.png)

Explanation:

* The green files have been added to the batch of push.
* The red ones are called untracked.

let us add a new file of untracked(red), so that it will become a tracked (green), the following image shows you that, we add one more file,
and `git status` shows us that it becomes green.

![git_add.png](../../../../images/dev_ops/github/git_add.png)

However, we still see two red pngs, and we can add a path, which is parent directories that contains those png images like the following,

![git_add_path.png](../../../../images/dev_ops/github/git_add_path.png)

## Step 4: Push all your tracked changes

Now that, we see everything we want in green, and that is a good sign, and now we want to push them to the remote git server.

* Let us do it! We will commit first.

`git commit -m "adding new files"`

![git_commit.png](../../../../images/dev_ops/github/git_commit.png)

* Next is to push to the remote server

![git_push.png](../../../../images/dev_ops/github/git_push.png)

* Next we want to verify that we successfully push our contents(into our branch) to the remote server.

We can go to the website, and find out where we push. In my case, I pushed to `main` branch directly,

![verify_git_push.png](../../../../images/dev_ops/github/verify_git_push.png)

## Step 5: Send a Pull Request

This is a request that you do on the webpage of github or bitbucket. What it does is to say you want to merge your branch to the destination branch, which could be any branches. In our case, it could be `main` branch.

![pull_request.png](../../../../images/dev_ops/github/pull_request.png)

## Step 6: Notify the code reviewer

In your pull request, which we often call PR, you will need to add your code reviewer and they will get an email and they will come to comment on your ticket and approve it.
