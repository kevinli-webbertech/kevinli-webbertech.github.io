# HW5 Jenkin + Github Private Repo

In the second lab of github of the following url,

- https://kevinli-webbertech.github.io/blog/md/courses/dev_ops/github/labs/Setup_SSH_KEY_GITHUB_lab2.pdf

We discussed how to add a ssh public key into the github remote server and how to validate that public key is successful.

Prior to that, when we do the Jenkin lab of the following tutorial,

- https://kevinli-webbertech.github.io/blog/html/courses/dev_ops/jenkin/Jenkin_Integration_with_github.html

We build a Jenkinfile with pipeline job to successfully build a Java artifact jar file from the Jenkin job. (part of your HW4).

In this homework, we would like to build a Jenkin job from a private github repo, and get the artifact.

Here is a breakdown of the grading,

* Adding public key to Github server (25 pts)

* Validate the public key hash. (10 pts)

* Setting up a Jenkin pipeline with Github private repo and provide full Jenkinfile. (25 pts)

* Show that the final artifact jar is generated. (25 pts)

* A nicely written report. (15 pts)
