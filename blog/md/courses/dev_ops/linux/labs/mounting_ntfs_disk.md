# In-class Lab Mounting NTFS Disk in Linux

## Abstract

In this lab, we will show you how to mount a harddisk of Microsoft NTFS into Linux server.
This is often used in data center of companies or schools.

## Permanently mounting the disk partition

### Step 1 Identify the disk and partitions that were added to the linux machine

First I use `sudo fdisk -l` to view all the partitions and hard drive on my linux system.

### Step 2 view the partition UUID 

In order to mount my NTFS hard drive taken from an old windows server, I need to mount the disk/partition into my linux machine using /etc/fstab. However, we might need to take the partition or diskâ€™s UUID, and we need another command,
The other command I use is the `blkid`, and it allows me to see all the UUID of the system.

Now I am getting the UUID of that partition of /dev/sdb1,

```
/dev/sdb1: LABEL="New Volume" BLOCK_SIZE="512" UUID="1074F6E274F6CA0C" TYPE="ntfs" PARTLABEL="Basic data partition" PARTUUID="fb7c74c5-3854-483c-b91d-21a3f24965a7"
```

### Step 3 Create a mounting directory

And we want to make sure that, we did create a folder before we reboot or let this fstab file to take effect.

`sudo mkdir /mnt/ntfs`

### Step 4 Mounting the disk to a directory using /etc/fstab

You can learn VIM editor commands in latter of the class, but when you first time to modify the /etc/fstab, I would recommend you to backup this file before you modify it,
You can use `sudo` and `cp` to make another copy.

To permanently mount the partition into the linux machine, so next time, when we boot up the machine, the drive is always good for use.

We will use the `mount` command to add a line of instruction into `/etc/fstab` and we need to use `sudo` which is a root permission to modify this file and save it.
So here I use the `vim` editor to add this line,

![fstab.png](fstab.png)

Once we open the /etc/fstab, we will add the last line there [you see the UUID],

## One-off mounting with `mount` command

Or you can run the following command to simplify the process so that you might not need to grab the UUID of the partition.

`sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdb1 /mnt/ntfs`


>> Side-notes:
    As you can see in the /etc/fstab, there is a ntfs-3g, this is a unity that we might need to install, the command is like the follow, but in most cases, you might have had it already. sudo apt install ntfs-3g
