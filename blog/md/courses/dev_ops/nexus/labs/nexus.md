# Introduction to Nexus Repository Manager

## What is Nexus?

Nexus Repository Manager (often just called Nexus) is a powerful tool that helps developers and organizations store, manage, and distribute software artifacts.
Think of it as a "library" for your software components—whether they are Java JAR files, Python packages, Docker images, npm modules, or any other type of build dependency.

A version of Nexus Repository is still available for free as Sonatype Nexus Repository Community Edition, which is the successor to the previous Nexus OSS offering. It is designed for individual developers and small teams to manage components effectively. For larger deployments or more advanced features like high availability and SAML/SSO, you will need to upgrade to the paid Sonatype Nexus Repository Pro edition.  

### **What is Sonatype Nexus Repository Community Edition?**

* It is the free, community-focused version of Sonatype Nexus Repository. 
* It offers a robust platform for small development teams to manage their components. 
* It includes modern capabilities, support for new formats like Hugging Face, Cargo (Rust), and Composer (PHP), and integration with PostgreSQL and Kubernetes. 

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Update System and Install Docker

![Docker_Run](/blog/images/dev_ops/nexus/Docker_Run.PNG)

### Commands Used

- sudo apt update
- sudo apt install -y docker.io
- sudo systemctl enable docker
- sudo systemctl start docker

### Commands Explained

- (sudo apt install -y docker.io) installs Docker from the default Ubuntu repositories. -y automatically says "yes" to prompts.

- (sudo systemctl enable docker) configures Docker to start automatically at boot.

- (sudo systemctl start docker) starts the Docker service right now so you can use it immediately.

### Step 2: Add Your User to Docker Group (avoid sudo every time)

### Commands Used

- sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
- newgrp docker 

### Commands Explained

- (sudo usermod -aG docker $USER) adds your user to the docker group so you can run Docker commands without sudo.

- (newgrp docker) applies the group change in your current terminal session immediately. Otherwise, you'd have to log out and back in.

## Step 3: Run Nexus Container

### Commands Used

```
docker run -d -p 8081:8081 --name nexus \
  -v nexus-data:/nexus-data \
  sonatype/nexus3
```

(This runs Nexus in a container and stores data in a persistent Docker volume nexus-data)

### Commands Explained

- docker run: Tells Docker to start a new container.

- -d: Detached mode — runs in the background.

- -p 8081:8081: Maps port 8081 on your machine to port 8081 inside the container. This is how you access the Nexus UI in your browser.

- --name nexus: Names your container "nexus" so you can refer to it easily later.

- -v nexus-data:/nexus-data: Creates and mounts a Docker volume named nexus-data to persist Nexus data (like configuration, repos, etc.) even if the container is deleted.

- sonatype/nexus3: The Docker image from Docker Hub — this pulls the official open-source Nexus Repository Manager 3 image.

## Step 4: Access Nexus Web UI

Open a browser and go to:

http://localhost:8081

### Commands Used:

`docker exec -it nexus cat /nexus-data/admin.password`

### Commands Explained:

- docker exec: Runs a command inside a running container.

- -it: Interactive + TTY, lets you interact as if in a terminal.

- nexus: The name of the container.

- cat /nexus-data/admin.password: Outputs the initial password file generated by Nexus.

## Step 6: Log In to Nexus UI

### Remember

- Username: admin
- Password: (paste the value you got from the step above)

You'll be prompted to change the password after you log in.
