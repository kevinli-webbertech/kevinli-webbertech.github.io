# Introduction to DevOps - Software Construction

## Goal

This is an 15-week introductory class to DevOps. One of the most popular and practical areas to insure our students's career path after graduation in this most challenging ML era. This class will teach us how to construct software by packing, distributing and delivering in a CICD (continuous integration and continous delivery) pipeline and it is used by almost all the companies currently.

The class will include linux system, docker, docker registry, jenkin, Kuberntes cluster, load balancers hands-on practices and many in-class and after class labs and experiments. The material here is the foundamental basis for Amazon AWS or GCP system administration, network and system architect certificates.

* 15-week including a mid-term Quiz and Final project. (No paper tests. All projects.)
* Online canvas quiz included.
