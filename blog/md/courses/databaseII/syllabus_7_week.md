## Survey

* How many people knows Python language.
* How many people knows Java language.
* How many people know C programming language.
* How many people have learned data structures in either C, Python or Java.

## Textbook

* **No textbooks required**. All would be provided via my personal research website,

>Hint: This would help you with installation and programming with SQL and Dbeaver.

The followings are the books I will be using for my teaching contents.

## Course Schedule

| Week    | Course                           |
|---------|----------------------------------|
| Week1   | Relational database Intro        |
| Week2   | SQL Programming 1                |
| Week3   | SQL Programming 2                |
| Midterm | Online quiz                      |
| Week4   | MongoDB Programming 1            |
| Week5   | MongoDB Programming 2            |
| Week5 - Final project assignment 2 weeks   |
| Week6 | Cassandra Programming              |
| Week7 | Python Programming with XML        |

* Midterm is online quiz (we take online quiz remotely)
* The Final project is a database design project

## Goal

* 7-week including a mid-term Quiz and Final project (No final exam but database design).
* This is an advanced level Database system class. Our topics are explained in the following list,

**The followings are required**
  
  * Relational database systems including relational model, algebra, ER diagram, normalization and UML
  * SQL Programming (Basic, and intermediate level)
  * NoSQL (Cassandra and Mongo)
  * XML
  * Python programming with MySQL, SQLite and Cassandra

**The followings are optional**

  * HTTP Protocol and Microservice architecture
  * Web application development using SQL (HTML, Javascript, Python or Java framework for http server)
  * Database internal data structure algorithms.
  * Distributed file system and data storage using Hadoop.

We will provide you the optional information above and talked about them but it may not require a lot of homework with them.

## Homework Policies

* Per week or biweekly. Depending on the homework size.
* Our grading points are based on 100 pts.
* Late submission is subjected to 10 points subsized.
* All the tasks/assignment questions in each homework is eventually getting scored.
  If one assignment has subtasks, then subtasks will eventually shared the points. For instance, 14 questions, each would be 100/14 pts.
* You should submit/upload word/pdf and for any queries or running-code assignment, you must provide screenshosts to prove your code is working. For design questions or coding questions, you must provide source code or it is subjected to 10-15 pts loss in your score.

## Performance

* Attendence 5% (3 times missing classes will take off 5 pts out of 100 pts)
* Homework 30%
* Quiz 30%
* Final 35%
