# Solana Tutorial


## Beginner Guide - Anchor framework

Solana programs are primarily developed using the Rust programming language. This page focuses on writing Solana programs in Rust without using the Anchor framework, an approach often referred to as writing "native Rust" programs.

Native Rust development provides developers with direct control over their Solana programs. However, this approach requires more manual setup and boilerplate code compared to using the Anchor framework. This method is recommended for developers who:

Seek granular control over program logic and optimizations
Want to learn the underlying concepts before moving to higher-level frameworks

- Rust: The programming language for building Solana programs.
- Solana CLI: Command-line tool for Solana development.
