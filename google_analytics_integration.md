Google Analytics is used to track website performance and collect visitor insights. It can help organizations determine top sources of user traffic, gauge the success of their marketing activities and campaigns, track goal completions (such as purchases, or adding products to carts), discover patterns and trends in user engagement, and obtain other visitor information such as demographics.

Google Analytics is easy to use. Besides powerful analytics capabilities, it includes built-in automation, provides a broad range of reporting options and can be integrated with other tools to become a single-measurement source of truth for customer data and insights. It also supports custom data analyses to fit the needs of different businesses. A business is on the path to a competitive advantage if it can analyze the broad span of customer journey touchpoints.

User acquisition data provides insight into how customers are arriving at a website.
